# GMOAT Greatest Movies Of All Time
A small React App for showing Top rated movies ranked by calculating the average ratings of the world most populare movies websites (IMDB, Metacritic, ...).

This app uses [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API for fetching detailed movies data.
In this app I use and share my own API key, you can create your one, read more infos about TMDB API [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).
